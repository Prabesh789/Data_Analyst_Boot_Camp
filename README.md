# Data Analyst Bootcamp
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Data Analyst Bootcamp (by Alex The Analyst, free on YouTube).
## Overview

### MySQL Beginner Level covered the following topics:

1. **SELECT Statements**: Techniques for retrieving specific data from a database.
2. **WHERE, LIKE, and HAVING Clauses**: Understanding their uses and differences in filtering and querying data.
3. **ORDER BY and GROUP BY**: Methods for sorting and grouping data for better insights.
4. **LIMIT and Aliasing**: Techniques for restricting query results and renaming columns for clarity.

### MySQL Intermediate Level covered the following topics:

1. **JOINs**: Merging data from multiple tables based on related columns.
2. **UNION**: Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set, stacking the rows from each SELECT on top of each other.
3. **String Functions**: Utilizing functions like COUNT, LOCATE, REPLACE, SUBSTRING, and more to manipulate and analyze text data.
4. **Case Statements**:  Applying conditional logic directly in SQL queries.
5. **Subqueries**: Writing queries within queries for complex data retrieval.
6. **Window Functions**: Performing calculations across rows related to the current row in the result set.

### MySQL Advanced Level covered the following topics:

1. **CTEs**: A Common Table Expression (CTE) in MySQL is a temporary result set defined with the WITH keyword, used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. It offers a more readable and reusable alternative to subqueries.
2. **Temporary Table**: Temporary tables in MySQL are session-specific tables that automatically drop when the session ends, useful for storing intermediate results within that session.
3. **Stored Procedures**: Stored procedures in MySQL are a feature to store and reuse complex SQL queries, include control-flow statements, and accept parameters. They're great for automating tasks, enhancing code reuse, and simplifying operations.
4. **Triggers & Events**:
    #Triggers: Blocks of code that execute automatically when specific events occur on tables.
    #Events: Scheduled tasks managed by the MySQL Event Scheduler.

### Data Cleaning in MySQL

(I have used the updated dataset from Kaggle: [Layoffs 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022), so there are a less issues with cleaning data compared to what is shown in the video.)

In this process, the following steps are performed:

1. **Check and Remove Duplicates**: Identify and eliminate any duplicate records to ensure each row is unique.
2. **Standardize the Data**: Address issues with spelling, spaces, and formatting to maintain consistency across the dataset.
3. **Handle Null and Blank Values**: Review and manage null and blank values to ensure data completeness and integrity.
4. **Remove Unnecessary Columns and Rows**: Eliminate columns and rows that are not required for analysis or processing.

### Exploratory Data Analysis in MySQL

Previous cleaned data is used for EDA.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**: It helps understand the dataset's structure, identify key variables, detect outliers, and uncover patterns and relationships, providing insights before applying statistical models.
